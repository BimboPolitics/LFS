Personally im building KDE plasma 5 for my desktop so im using this space to add notes about problems i ran into and what i did to fix them.

After installing QT and following the instructions for setup run "source /etc/profile.d/qt5.sh" the book doesnt say this but you should do it.



When installing Aspell it tells you to install a dictionary. US english speakers want this one. https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/aspell/dict/en/aspell6-en-2020.12.07-0.tar.bz2

Untar it, cd into it then follow the install instructions in the book.
