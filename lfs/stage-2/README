Create a temporary area that contains the main toolbox,
isolated from host system.

First you need to find out the name of the working platform, which is often called
target triplet. An easy way to determine the name of the target triplet is to run
the config.guess script that comes with the source code for many packages.
For example, unpack the binutils source code and run the script config.guess:

    # ./config.guess
    x86_64-pc-linux-gnu

You should also know the name of the dynamic platform linker, often called
dynamic loader (not to be confused with the standard ld linker, which
is part of binutils). The dynamic linker provided by Glibc is
finds and loads the shared libraries needed by the program, prepares
program to run and then runs it. Dynamic linker name
can be determined by checking any binary from the host system:

    # readelf -l /bin/ls  | /bin/grep interpreter
    [Requesting program interpreter: /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2]

    We see that the name of the dynamic linker is ld-linux-x86-64.so.2

# vim:ft=conf
