At the moment, all cyclical dependencies have been eliminated, and therefore we can
use the 'chroot' environment, completely isolating the host operating system behind
excluding a running kernel. It is in the chroot that we will collect the last parts
of our system:
    - missing tools needed to build packages
    - three packages required to run tests

###
# All packages are collected in the order STRICTLY corresponding to the list in the file ./queue
###

IMPORTANT NOTE
queue.sh is complete for this stage. Use it.

To build a package in the environment chroot:
    1) copy to /mnt/lfs/
        - check_environment.sh
        - unpack_source_archive.sh
        - <pkg_name>.sh
    2) go to the chroot environment
        # entering-chroot-env.sh
    3) run the build script for the package
        # /<pkg_name>.sh

# vim:ft=conf
