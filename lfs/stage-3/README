Building the base system linux
----------------------------
At this stage it is *not* recommended to use any optimization options in the
compiler, unless otherwise specified in the build script. Even if the package is successful
compiling when using optimization, there is a risk that it will
not compiled correctly due to complex interactions between the code and
assembly tools.

###
# The order of assembly of packages occurs in the order STRICTLY corresponding to the list in
# file ./queue
###


IMPORTANT NOTE.

Do not run ./queue.sh its not ready yet. You will have to run each script in the queue order manually.

- copy the auxiliary scripts for building to the root of the LFS system (/mnt/lfs)
    ./check_environment.sh
    ./config_file_processing.sh
    ./unpack_source_archive.sh
    ./write_to_var_log_packages.sh

- copy the build script <pkg_name.sh> to the root of the LFS system (/mnt/lfs/)

- go to the chroot environment
    # ./entering-chroot-env.sh

- run the build script
    # /pkg_name.sh

# vim:ft=conf
