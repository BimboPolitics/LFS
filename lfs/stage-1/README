1)Checking the host system for all the necessary components for building LFS
   systems:
    # ./check-host-system-requirements.sh

2) Preparing the hard disk partition on which we will assemble the LFS system:
    - formatting
    - file system creation ext4
    - mounting
    - creating a minimal set of directories:
        /mnt/lfs/{bin,etc,lib,lib64,sbin,sources,tools,usr,var}

    ### Important ###
    
In the partitions-init.sh script, set the variable PART (section for
    LFS system builds, by default "/dev/sda10"). The section will be mounted
    in /mnt/lfs

    # ./partitions-init.sh

3) Creating an lfs group and user, under which we will collect temporary
   tools for building an LFS system, as well as setting up a working environment
   for this user (~/.bash_profile, ~/.bashrc)
    # ./create-lfs-user.sh

4) We download all the necessary sources and patches for building in /mnt/lfs/sources
    # ./download-src.sh

# vim:ft=conf
