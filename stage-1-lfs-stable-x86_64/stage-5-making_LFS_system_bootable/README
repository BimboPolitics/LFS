In this final part, we will make the LFS system bootable: create
/ etc / fstab, build the kernel and modules, configure the GRUB or LILO boot loader. After
building and configuring all packages in this directory, the base LFS system will
fully assembled. The / mnt / lfs / sources directory can be removed after
reboot to enter the "live" system.

###
# IMPORTANT !!!
###
# Open the etc-fstab.sh script and check the variables
# SWAP_PART - points to a swap partition of a hard disk or to a swap file
# ROOT_PART - LFS system root partition

###
# If / boot is on a separate partition on the host system, then the LFS kernel of the system
# should be set there. The easiest way to do this is
# mount / boot host to / boot directory of LFS system
mount -v --bind / boot / mnt / lfs / boot
###

###
# The order of assembly of packages is in the order STRICTLY corresponding to the list in
# file ./queue
###

- copy the auxiliary scripts for building and the kernel config to the LFS root
  systems (/mnt/lfs)
    ./check_environment.sh
    ./config_file_processing.sh
    ./write_to_var_log_packages.sh
    ./lfs-kernel-config-x.x.x

- copy the assembly script <pkg_name.sh> to the root of the LFS system (/mnt/lfs/)

- go to the chroot environment
    # ./entering-chroot-env.sh

- run the build script
    # /pkg_name.sh


# vim:ft=conf
