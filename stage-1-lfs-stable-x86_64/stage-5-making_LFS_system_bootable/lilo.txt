/etc/lilo.conf (/ dev / sda10 change to the partition on which the root is installed
LFS system), and of course after editing the config
    # lilo

# LFS bootable partition config begins
image = /boot/vmlinuz-lfs
  root = /dev/sda10
  label = LFS-stable
  read-only  # Partitions should be mounted read-only for checking
# LFS bootable partition config ends

# vim:ft=conf
